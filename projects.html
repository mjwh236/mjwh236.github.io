<h3>Maze Generation with Solver</h3>
    <p>This project was one of the more difficult asignments
        from from Computer Graphics Class. This project was 
        created in java. When generating the maze a randomized
        depth-first search is preformed from each square of
        the grid to create the walls of the maze. The 
        dimensions of the maze can be set indepenantly and by
        the user. The maze generation can both be stopped and
        resumed via buttons. The speed of solving the maze can
        be adjusted using the slider.

<h3>CatHacks Winter 2020, Paint by Numbers</h3>
    <p>This project began as an attempt to create a paint by
        numbers image from a user inputed image. The resulting
        software allows the user to preform several different 
        image manipulations on their image.
