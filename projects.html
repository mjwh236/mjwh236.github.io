<h3>Maze Generation with Solver</h3>
    <p>This project was one of the more difficult asignments
        from from Computer Graphics Class. This project was 
        created in java. When generating the maze a randomized
        depth-first search is preformed from each square of
        the grid to create the walls of the maze. The 
        dimensions of the maze can be set indepenantly and by
        the user. The maze generation can both be stopped and
        resumed via buttons. The speed of solving the maze can
        be adjusted using the slider.

<h3>CatHacks Winter 2020, Paint by Numbers</h3>
    <p>This project began as an attempt to create a paint by
        numbers image from a user inputed image. The resulting
        software allows the user to preform several different 
        image manipulations on their image.

    <h3>User Login Portal</h3>
    <p>This project is a basic website that implements a 
        user login portal that is entirely functional. This 
        site allows users to register a new acount with 
        their information and credentials, sign in to their
        current account, and change their account information.
        The front end of this project uses minimal CSS but is 
        styled using Bootstrap and uses Handlebars for HTML 
        templating. The back end is much more interesting for me.
        The backend uses Node.js and the Express module to create and run the web 
        server. I used the conf library to create a simple 
        database.
    </p>
    <h3>Simple Shell</h3>
    <p>This project is very low-level and systems based. 
        This basic shell program allows line by line input 
        or input from a script file. In this shell I have 
        recreated some terminal programs from general unix
        machine. Those programs are "cd", "setenv", and 
        "exit". If a user requests to run a program other 
        than the ones I implemented, a new process will be 
        forked and redirected to the local system to see if 
        that program is installed. This project was the most
        C programming I have ever done.
